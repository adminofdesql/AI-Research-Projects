# Emotional Depth Building and Taboo Relations with a Twisted Plot

In fictional stories, taboo relations, or in this case, a teacher-student relationship, are considered one of the niche stereotypes that rarely change the foundational trope upon which these stories are laid. Either the premise follows the usual romantic approach, with or without a power play, or it is simply for the sake of drama. Most of these stereotypes differ hugely depending on how real-life scenarios play out in these cases.

Artificial intelligence has been used to backdrop these taboo relations to ensure that with added prompts or guidance from the user, it does not stray from breaking social boundaries in most cases, especially regarding human emotions.

In this case study, we will discuss how AI behaves or generates output with human guidance to see how it deals with the above-mentioned norms in storytelling, as well as to see how deeply it resonates with human emotions.

## The Problem

As taboo relations, primarily the older female, younger male trope, are not extensively broad in pop culture media, some stories do, however, vaguely or subtly explore the narrative of psychological or romantic aspects. In real-life scenarios, these cases are also rarely discussed. So, the biggest challenge was how to approach such a scenario with AI so that it seems unique rather than generating a generic output to get the best results.

The solution was to blend a sort of relationship triangle, which gives us more room to navigate distant human emotions and feelings. While the idea itself was generic, the way to formulize it was a key challenge. So, after meticulous thinking and getting inspiration from sources that have already blended this formula, I was able to find a way forward.

One of the prime inspirations for this was the Japanese manga named *Domestic Kanojo*, which relied on human psychology and dynamics rather than the usual romantic path. I was able to break through on how to manifest this particular idea with AI.

## Using AI to Build a Structure, Narrative, and Characters

Using DeepSeek AI, it was easy to build the structure as well as the other elements. This goes to show how far DeepSeek has improved over the months. Generally, AI would shy away from such a topic; however, clear prompts and a quality narrative helped a lot in how this story was created.

## Challenges

So far, using DeepSeek, minimal issues were faced, particularly in avoiding the narrative that the AI usually refuses to generate. However, one of the primary issues faced was repetitive content. This, however, can be solved with added prompts or assistance to get satisfactory results, but that was absolutely essential to think about. The main challenge was to see if AI could keep up with the user's narrative to navigate through the human emotions layered with taboo subjects. Unlike sensitive issues, since we didn't have to deal with such a premise, facing those issues was also out of the question so far.

## Conclusion

From my research, it is clear that with added guidance and correct prompting, AI can be an absolute game-changer when exploring taboo relations and heavy human emotions. Though the reply from the machine can be a bit underwhelming or hard to understand, what the narrative needs is a human touch to bring those stories to life.
