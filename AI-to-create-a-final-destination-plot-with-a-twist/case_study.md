# Adding a Groundbreaking Twist to an Already Established World

### Introduction

The *Final Destination* franchise has been around for almost two decades, spanning six movies, with *Final Destination: Bloodlines* released recently.

The core plot of these movies involves a cast trying to escape the clutches of Death, only for their fates to circle back in a nihilistic fashion. The movies' blend of mystery and thrill, centered on understanding how Death operates and the characters' desperate attempts to escape it, is what has hooked fans for years. It has been cemented as one of the most successful franchises in its genre.

As a fan of the franchise, one thing has always bothered me. Death is a universal law; every living being must face its demise, no matter how hard or for how long it survives. The act of dying is a part of nature and shouldn’t be viewed as a nihilistic event. The *Final Destination* franchise frames Death as an antagonist. This framing, however, is what drives the gruesome and elaborate ways in which the characters meet their demise.

So, I decided to explore the idea that death is a normal process, and that if a person could foresee their end, they should choose to live the remainder of their life to the fullest instead of trying to avoid it. With this idea in mind, I used DeepSeek to generate a premise centered around this concept and to analyze how an AI might interpret the nature of life and death.

**Note:** This idea was inspired by the late actor Tony Todd. Knowing he was ill during the filming of his last movie, he was told to improvise a line in one of his scenes:
> "I intend to enjoy the time I have left. And I suggest you do the same. Life is precious. Enjoy every single second. You never know when... Good luck."

This is a very powerful line, and my whole premise revolves around it. RIP Tony Todd.

### Methodology

The process was straightforward: I prompted DeepSeek AI and its Deepthink feature to generate a *Final Destination* plotline with this new twist. As the conversation progressed, I prompted it to add further tweaks to the characters and the plot.

### Key Findings

When I asked DeepSeek to write the plot, the model demonstrated a strong capacity for generating a storyline that aligned with the core philosophical twist. It is safe to assume that DeepSeek AI's training data includes facts about the plots of the *Final Destination* movies. Even with the new twist, it was able to deliver satisfactory results.

One problem was that the AI model went overboard, adding extra elements that were unnecessary for the plot. This, however, resulted from a misinterpreted prompt and was fixed with an additional clarification. Another problem was the inconsistency of story events, as demonstrated in the full [Raw Chat Thread](https://github.com/Noyonbond47/AI-to-create-a-final-destination-plot-with-a-twist/blob/main/raw_chat_thread.pdf), which is easily solvable with more detailed prompting about the sequence of events.

However, this was not a major issue, as the goal of this case study was to see if an AI could add a twist that subverts the mechanics of an established world, and if an LLM's training could enable it to output deeper statements on the concept of life and death. And surprisingly, it delivered more than expected.

### Conclusion

This study successfully demonstrates that generative AI, with expert human guidance, can be a powerful tool for subverting established fictional worlds and exploring deep philosophical themes. It proves that the technology's potential extends beyond simple content generation into complex conceptual development. This includes the ability to subvert an established world and to demonstrate how far an LLM's (in this case, DeepSeek's) capabilities can go in understanding the profound, inevitable nature of death—showing that it is not a nihilistic event, but simply the final destination.
