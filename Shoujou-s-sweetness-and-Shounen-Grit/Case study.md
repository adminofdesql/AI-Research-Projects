# How AI Handles Opposite Stereotypes of Plots in a Single Storyline

In this case study, I used AI to find out how it analyzes and processes the term "dual personality" when a user is generating a storyline that is intertwined or just another part of the worldbuilding.

## Inspiration

In pop culture media, there are many stories that deal with a dual storytelling trope within the same circle of characters. For example, in the *Scott Pilgrim vs. The World* franchise, the main character Scott’s love for Ramona Flowers revolves around him trying his best to get closer to her while fighting off Ramona’s exes in a repetitive narrative structure that balances romance and action. Similarly, in *Titanic*, Jack’s love for Rose can also shift the momentum from the ship’s eventual demise. The romance in these situations is added alongside the other side of the story of how the narrative unravels. So, I used AI to explore using one part of the story to tell a romantic fiction while the remaining side is used for other categories of stereotypes, which again revolves around the same set of characters.

Instead, I used AI to develop such a story without the same cast being revolved around the plot. Instead, I used two sets of different worldbuilding and merged them side-by-side to see how and if AI can handle such a method of generating the story without breaking immersion or the natural flow of the content.

## The Challenge

As mentioned, AI does well with the storytelling of the same worldbuilding within its established cast. The major issue was how to approach the idea of blending opposite stereotype plots in a single storyline. The approach was to establish two different characters that might or might not have a good relationship but are somehow not close to each other most of the time. The ideal solution was to place them in a situation where they live together, sharing spaces within their residence. (Please refer to the 1st prompt given in the raw chat thread).

The next step was to approach the different lifestyles, which leads to different worldviews and an immersive storyline.

As we developed the way the plot would unfold, the AI assistant handled the development of the story exceptionally well.

## Success and Unsatisfactory Results

While the AI did handle the point of the story and the dual distinction the worldview had to offer, it took a tremendous amount of prompt sessions to keep things smooth. While the AI did offer some assistance by understanding what and how the storyline would progress or the elements the story will have, the major issue was that without further commands or any other supervision to keep track of the world, some unnecessary elements that totally deferred from my expectations were introduced by the AI. Additionally, without checking up on further elements added by the AI, those same elements would be constantly brought up by the AI in accordance with its assumption that the user approved them, whether or not the user actually liked them. This totally depends on the user's clarification.

## Conclusion

While introducing a fresh premise with distinct storytelling, the AI handled it exceptionally well. However, constant clarification of the premise and keeping track of everything is a huge hassle for the user.
