Takeda (17):

High school delinquent surviving street wars.

Aoi (17):

Sukeban transfer student rescued by Takeda from her abusive gang leader.

Major Plot Arcs
Volume 1: Cohabitation Chaos
Yamada invites Shiori to move into his apartment, sharing space with his "harmless" roommate Takeda.

Takeda’s double life surfaces: By day, a stoic student/mechanic; by night, a vigilante dismantling gangs.

Running Gag: Shiori misreads Takeda’s injuries as "clumsy mechanic work," gifting cat-themed bandaids.

Volume 2: Shadows in the Corner (Aoi’s Arc)
Takeda saves Aoi from her gang leader, sparking a brutal alley fight (Holyland-style).

Aoi appears at the apartment—homeless and hunted. Takeda takes her in under strict rules:

"Stay hidden. No noise. Leave when I say."

The couple remains oblivious to Aoi’s presence, misreading clues (her shampoo scent, hairpins).

Volume 3: Four’s a Crowd (Vacation Arc)
Yamada/Shiori invite Takeda on a beach trip. He insists on bringing "a friend" (Aoi) to avoid leaving her alone.

Tension: Aoi nearly blows their cover multiple times:

Knowing Takeda’s habits (AC settings, candy stash).

Slipping up at the ryokan ("I practi—starved!").

Soft Moments: Takeda buys Aoi shaved ice; she sleeps on his shoulder during the drive home.

Volume 4: Storms on the Horizon
Gang Retaliation: Aoi’s ex-leader, Kaito, vandalizes Takeda’s garage and leaves cat-symbol threats.

Near-Discoveries:

Shiori finds gang graffiti near the apartment.

Yamada’s strict father visits, grilling Shiori (almost uncovering Aoi).

Fractured Trust: Aoi confesses her abusive past; Takeda softens but denies it.

Themes & Motifs
Dramatic Irony: Readers see Takeda/Aoi’s battles; the couple sees domestic bliss.

Found Family: Shared meals, laundry, and cat-themed gifts bind the four.

Duality:

Yamada/Shiori: Safety, romance, office politics.

Takeda/Aoi: Survival, strategic fights, hidden scars.

Symbols:

Wrenches/Tools: Takeda’s weapons vs. Yamada’s repaired bracelets.

Cats: Shiori’s kindness vs. Aoi’s stealth.

Current Status
