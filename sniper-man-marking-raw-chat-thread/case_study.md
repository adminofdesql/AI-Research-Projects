
# Can AI help to analyze new sports tactics that have never been heard of?

## Introduction

A large part of the reason why the Large Language Model has been popularized is largely thanks to how these models were developed and how they were trained.

The developers of such models train their AI models not only to give accurate feedback reflecting real life situations but also giving high analysis results to something much more complex and almost that has never been seen in real life scenarios.

And to confirm my statement, I used 4 different Large Language Models and gave them the same prompt to see how accurate or even how they analize my request based on my prompt.

The prompt: “I have developed soccer tactics.
The term is Sniper man marking, which is a hybrid of traditional man marking and zonal marking.

What happens is basically a player fixated on a targeted opponent from 10 to 15 feet away, whenver the targeted player is about to get a ball or as soon as he gets the ball, the man marker sprint towards the player wins or intercepts the ball before he can get control and soon the ball is clear the man marker again maintain his postion from 15 feet away.

Give real-life examples of how it can be used, and the pros and cons also”

so as the prompt suggested I came up with real life strategy for the world's most popular and highly strategic sport. Though the idea of man marking is not something new, I approached with a hybrid or a new technique of this strategy and asked ai to give me feedback.

## Methodology

The reason for this specific prompt was to studies AI reply and behavior on analysis to see how it can work with a completely new strategy, this to see how the mentioned LLM models analyze my request, and the result and my finding from these results would reflect in my conclusive statement.

## Key findings

After Analyzing the reply from each LLM that I worked, I found out that AI capabilities of understanding, analysis on real life scenarios given on the reply. So, it is certain that AI has evolved not only recognizing real life patterns but applying them based on human request and so far, the result provided by these LLM has been satisfactory, that again was based on my request to give me both the advantages and disadvantages.

## Conclusion

The AI models provided satisfactory and high-analysis output. For instance, the AIs did not just give a generic definition but provided real-world analogies and examples of how the 'Sniper Man Marking' tactic could be used against different types of players. One AI suggested it could be used to neutralize a key playmaker like Kevin De Bruyne, while another analogized the core concepts to the defensive work of N'Golo Kanté. This demonstrates that AI can apply novel concepts to real-world scenarios, fulfilling the objectives of the study.
