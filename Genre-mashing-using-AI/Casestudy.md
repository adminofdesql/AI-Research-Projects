# Title: How AI handles multiple genre and storytelling background at once without breaking immersion.

## Introduction: As of 2025 many commercial artificial intelligence platform eg DeepSeek and chatgpt is been used by many hobbyist or full fledged writer to generate content for their story to publish it. Keeping that in money those Ai developer has been training and updating their Ai model to current demands generating flexible or creative story, those could generating fantasy stories sort of lord of the rings or harry potter esque worldbuilding or dune style dystopian storytelling, the human imagination is broad. This however is a limitation to Artificial Intelligence who clearly lacks the thinking of a human being. So to test how far Ai can handle a detailed worldbuilding without breaking the immersion. I decided to create a story with the help of DeepSeek AI not one or 2 but 5 distinct genre is Japanese media to see the capabilities of DeepSeek AI. Here is a breakdown of my 5 genre one story and my findings.

## List of contnents: 

* Overview of the 5 genre
* Inspiration to come up with the idea
* How I used DeepSeek AI to generate the story
* Success and challenges
* Conclusion

## Overview of the 5 genre: the genre I choose is based on the popular trope widely used in Japanese media, those are 

1. **Josei (女性)**
Aimed at adult women, Josei manga and anime delve into the realistic complexities of adult life. The narratives often revolve around themes of romantic relationships, career challenges, personal growth, and domestic life. Unlike its younger counterpart, Shoujo, Josei presents a more mature and nuanced perspective on love and life, often featuring established couples or exploring the intricacies of navigating adult relationships and societal expectations. The art style is typically more realistic and subdued.

Notable Examples:

Chihayafuru
Princess Jellyfish (Kuragehime)
Honey and Clover

2. **Shoujo (少女)**
Targeting a demographic of young girls and teenagers, Shoujo manga and anime primarily focus on romance, interpersonal relationships, and emotional growth. The stories are typically told from a female protagonist's point of view, emphasizing her feelings and experiences. Common tropes include first love, love triangles, and the importance of friendship. The art style is often characterized by large, expressive eyes and a soft, aesthetically pleasing aesthetic.

Notable Examples:

Sailor Moon
Fruits Basket
Kimi ni Todoke - From Me to You
3. Shounen Gag Comedy (少年ギャグ)
This subgenre of Shounen manga and anime is characterized by its relentless and often absurd humor. The primary goal is to make the audience laugh through a variety of comedic techniques, including slapstick, parody, witty banter, and nonsensical situations. While it falls under the Shounen demographic, which is typically aimed at young boys, the humor can appeal to a broader audience. These series often feature a cast of eccentric characters in bizarre and exaggerated scenarios.

Notable Examples:

Gintama
The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.
Daily Lives of High School Boys

4. **Shounen Delinquent (少年ヤンキー)**
Rooted in the Japanese "bancho" (delinquent leader) culture of the mid-20th century, this Shounen subgenre centers on the lives of high school delinquents. Themes of rebellion, honor among friends, gang rivalries, and intense fight scenes are prevalent. These stories often explore the characters' struggles against societal norms and their search for a sense of belonging. While featuring violence and conflict, they also emphasize camaraderie and the development of a personal code of ethics.

Notable Examples:

Tokyo Revengers
Crows
Beelzebub

5. **Noir/Seinen (ノワール)**
Drawing inspiration from classic film noir, this genre in manga and anime is defined by its dark and cynical tone. Noir narratives are typically crime stories featuring morally ambiguous protagonists, femme fatales, and a pervasive sense of pessimism. The visual style often employs stark lighting and shadows to create a somber and mysterious atmosphere. Plots are often complex and convoluted, exploring themes of corruption, betrayal, and the darker aspects of human nature.

Notable Examples:

Monster
Psycho-Pass
Death Note


## Inspiration to come up with the idea: there are many fanart or photo edit of pop culture icons of different media portrayed together. For example, there is a fanart *(see readme to find out more of this image)* of the character Hitori Gotō from the anime "Bocchi the Rock!", Sharing screen J.K simmons character from the movie "Whiplash", where the former character is shown as the drummer instructed under J.K Simmons character. The twist being despite sharing same themes about music these 2 stories differ in genre and medium as well as storytelling. 

## Same can be said with fan edit of a frame where Mordecai from regular show slapping griffith from berserk *(Read the readme files)*. This is just one of many example of crossovers images which differs in genre and storytelling and worldbuilding as well as form of media.

## A combination of these images and my fascination towards as I am hardcore pop culture consumer, inspired me to create a story that combines 5 distinct genre of Japanese media, which is Josei, Shoujo, Shounen Gag Comedy, Shounen Delinquent and Noir/Seinen. Sone of my types of genre into on seamless storyline.

## How I used DeepSeek AI to generate the story: At the time, I was experimenting with DeepSeek AI to see which platforms works best when dealing with creative writing. While ChatGpt provides much better and more detailed response, DeepSeek AI is more flexible in terms of generating content. So I decided to use DeepSeek AI to generate the story.

## I started by giving DeepSeek AI a prompt to generate a story that combines the 5 genre I mentioned above. I provided it with a brief outline of each genre and what sort of elements does this plot had and with added context *(The chat thread can be found on raw chat thread txt file)*. DeepSeek was able to generate a decent story that combines all 5 genre into one seamless storyline. Here is what I found from this chat thread until our last inreaction:
## Success and challenges: While DeepSeek is now fairly decent AI, at the time it had some limitations. The AI struggled to maintain the tone and style of each genre consistently throughout and fairly creating potholes and inconsistencies in the story. However this issue would be resolved by providing more context and details to the AI. Which needed detailed planning of the story, worldbuilding and character development prior to ask for prompt from the AI, to get succecsive results
## additaonally, The AI also seemed to add unnecessary elements that the user did not intent to use, however those added things easily be blended into the story, Thanks to DeepSeek model training as well as Data Analysis. This feature was indeed quite usefull as the reader wish to add, improve or remove it or get ideas how to work around that added stuff that the AI genrated which in a sense is little repetitive but is considered usefull if the user prompt improves with a unsatifactory generated result.
## Overall. from my experience, DeepSeek AI is a powerful tool for generating creative and cohesive content, but it requires careful planning and context to get the best results.

## Conclusion: From my research what started as a simple idea of combining 5 distinct genre of Japanese media into one seamless storyline, turned into a fascinating experiment in AI storytelling. While DeepSeek AI had its limitations, it was able to generate a decent story that combined all 5 genre into one cohesive narrative. The key to success was careful planning and providing the AI with enough context and details to work with.
