My Prompt: Create a heel persona. He is absolute dominating never relies on cheap trick, wins every match cleanly. Hates who relies on unethical methods to win match. His motto be the strongest

DeepThink: Okay, the user wants me to create a heel persona for wrestling. Wait, heel is a villain, right? But this heel is different. He's dominant, never uses cheap tricks, wins cleanly. Hates those who use unethical methods. His motto is "be the strongest." Hmm, interesting. So he's a heel but with a code of honor. That's a twist. Usually heels cheat, but this one doesn't. So how to make him a villain then? Maybe he's arrogant, looks down on others, enforces his own rules.
First, I need a name. Should sound strong, maybe something like "The Paragon" but with a menacing twist. Paragon Magnus? Magnus suggests greatness. Or maybe "The Sovereign" something that conveys dominance. Name: Viktor "The Sovereign" Kane. Viktor for victory, Kane as a strong surname.
Appearance: Imposing, maybe 6'5", 265 lbs. Muscular but agile. Attire: all white and gold, pristine, regal. White symbolizes purity, gold for superiority. Maybe a long coat with a high collar. Stoic expression, no face paint. Intimidating presence.
Entrance Theme: Orchestral, choir chanting in Latin. Builds anticipation. Spotlight on him, walks slowly, ignores fans. Maybe a throne on the stage to sit, showing dominance.
In-Ring Style: Technical mastery, submission holds. Uses moves like German suplex, knee strikes. Targets limbs methodically. No weapons, no interference. Wins with clean pins or submissions. Finisher: "Crown's Decree" – a modified armbar with a knee to the spine. Submission finisher. Another finisher: "Thronebreaker" – a sit-out powerbomb. Both decisive.
Personality: Cold, calculating. Believes strength is everything. Despises cowards who cheat. Mic skills: calm, articulate speeches. Mocks opponents for their lack of discipline. Quotes Sun Tzu or Nietzsche. Backstage: no allies, demands respect. Refuses scripted promos, stays in character.
Feuds: Targets cheaters. Calls them "false kings." Matches are brutal but fair. After winning, lectures the fallen opponent.
Catchphrases: "Kneel before strength." "A king needs no crown when he has a spine of steel." "You don’t lose to me. You lose to your own weakness."
Long-Term Story: Undefeated streak. Challenges legends to prove he's the best. Eventually faces a face who uses underhanded tactics, testing his resolve. Maybe a betrayal angle where a protege cheats to win, leading to a crisis of faith.
Wait, the user mentioned he's a heel but wins clean. So the audience might respect him but dislike his arrogance. He's a heel because he's condescending, merciless, not because he cheats. Maybe the fans boo him for his dismissive attitude towards them and other wrestlers. But he's a complex character, a villain with principles. That could create interesting storylines where the audience is torn between respecting his integrity and hating his arrogance.
Need to make sure his motivations are clear. He sees himself as the true champion, others are unworthy. His hatred for cheaters adds depth. Maybe he's on a crusade to purify the wrestling world, but his methods are too harsh. That could lead to conflicts with authority figures as well.
Also, his entrance with a throne and ignoring fans sets him apart. He doesn't care about the crowd's reaction, which makes him a heel. The white and gold attire contrasts with typical heel colors (black, red), showing his unique approach. His moves are punishing but legal, so the referees can't stop him. Opponents are defeated cleanly but humiliated psychologically.
In feuds, he might target a popular wrestler who uses shortcuts, exposing their weaknesses. Even if the crowd likes the other wrestler, he dismantles them methodically, making the crowd question their hero's methods. This creates moral ambiguity, which is good for storytelling.
Need to ensure his motto "be the strongest" is reflected in every aspect. His training, his demeanor, his interactions. He might have a backstory where he was wronged by cheaters in the past, driving his current ethos. But maybe he's too rigid, leading to his downfall when faced with adaptability.
Overall, the key points are dominance, clean wins, disdain for cheaters, and a regal, arrogant persona. Balancing heel traits with honorable traits makes him a nuanced character. The user probably wants a compelling antagonist who challenges the typical heel tropes, providing fresh storylines.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My Prompt: He also has another principal, honor the ones who fought hard, even if they lose. And if he loses in fair fight he gives his respect to them

DeepThink: Okay, so I need to update Viktor Kane's persona based on the new information. The user wants him to honor those who fought hard, even if they lose, and if he loses a fair fight, he shows respect. Let me think about how to integrate that without contradicting his existing traits.
First, his current persona is a dominant heel who despises cheaters and wins cleanly. Adding this honorable aspect might make him more of a tweener, but the user still wants him as a heel. So I need to balance his arrogance with this newfound respect for worthy opponents.
Maybe his honor code is rigid. He respects hard work and effort, but only if it's done the "right way." So even if someone loses, if they fought honorably and pushed him to his limits, he acknowledges them. But he'd still look down on others who don't meet his standards.
When he loses, which should be rare, he'd show respect, but in a condescending way. Like, he might give a nod or a slight bow, but with a smirk, as if saying, "You surprised me, but don't expect it to happen again." This maintains his heel persona because the respect is backhanded.
I should adjust his personality/mic work section. Maybe he still quotes philosophers but adds something about strength in honor. His catchphrases could include lines about recognizing true warriors. Also, his feuds might involve him targeting those who disrespect the sport, even if they're faces, because they don't meet his honor code.
In-ring, perhaps after a tough match, he offers a handshake but then snubs the audience, keeping his heel heat. Or maybe he raises his opponent's hand but then berates the crowd for not appreciating true effort. That way, he's honoring the opponent but still being a jerk to the fans.
I need to check existing sections for consistency. His appearance and moves are fine, but maybe add a moment where he acknowledges a fallen opponent post-match. His finishers could have a variant where, after winning, he places the medallion but then maybe adds a token of respect if the opponent was worthy.
Also, his motivations: he's not just purging frauds but also elevating those who fight honorably, even if they lose. Maybe a story arc where he reluctantly teams up with a face who meets his standards, but still maintains his superiority.
Catchphrases like "You fought well... for a peasant." Mixes respect with disdain. Or "Your honor is noted, but your weakness remains."
Theme song remains the same, but maybe a slight variation when he shows respect, like a somber note in the music.
I need to make sure that his respect doesn't make him a face. He's still arrogant and looks down on everyone, but there's a twisted honor code. The audience might boo him for his condescending respect, but it adds depth to his character.
Possible feuds: A face who keeps losing but earns his respect over time, leading to a mutual rivalry. Or a heel who cheats but once fought honorably, making Viktor conflicted.
In his code of honor section, specify that he only respects those who meet his strict criteria. Maybe he has a ritual, like leaving a white rose in the ring for a worthy opponent, but then stepping on it as he exits, showing that even honor can't save them from defeat.
Mic work: He could give a speech after a match, praising the opponent's effort but belittling the fans for not demanding such excellence always. This keeps his heel heat while adding layers.
Also, if he loses, he might concede gracefully but vow to come back stronger, maintaining his dominance. The key is that his respect is rare and on his terms, so it doesn't soften him too much.
I think that's the balance. Now, structure these ideas into the existing sections without contradicting the original. Add the honor elements while keeping his Sovereign persona intact.

AI Reply: Updated Wrestling Persona: "The Sovereign" Viktor Kane

Additions/Revisions to Original Persona:

Personality/Mic Work:

Twisted Honor Code: While still radiating icy arrogance, Viktor acknowledges opponents who push him to his limits with pure skill and grit. Post-match, he might coldly declare, "You fought with honor... a rarity in this cesspool of incompetence," before turning his disdain toward the crowd.

Condescending Respect: If defeated fairly (a rare occurrence), he begrudgingly raises his opponent’s hand, sneering, "You’ve claimed a moment, not a throne," or drops a white rose at their feet—only to crush it under his boot as he leaves, symbolizing that even valor cannot mask weakness.

Mic Work: Blends backhanded praise with elitism. To a resilient face: "You are a diamond among swine. Pity the swine still outnumber you."

In-Ring Adjustments:

Post-Match Rituals:

After a hard-fought victory, he places his "Weakness" medallion on the opponent but adds a white rose if they earned his respect.

If he loses cleanly, he tosses his cape over the victor like a funeral shroud, growling, "Wear this crown of thorns—it will choke you in time."

New Signature Move: "Noble’s End" (A modified Tombstone Piledriver where he pauses mid-move to whisper, "You deserved better," then executes it brutally).

Feuds/Story Arcs:

Reluctant Alliance: Partners with a tenacious underdog face who survives his onslaught, only to betray them later: "You proved yourself a warrior... but warriors die for kings."

Respect Turned Rivalry: Battles a veteran known for integrity (e.g., a grizzled technician). After narrowly defeating them, Viktor demands the crowd applaud the foe’s legacy, then ruins the moment by calling them "a relic of a dead era."

Corruption of a Hero: Targets a rising star who starts cutting corners, leading Viktor to "expunge your potential before it rots."

Catchphrases (New):

"Honor dies when you do."

"You earned my respect. Now let me show you how little it’s worth."

"Bleed with dignity. It’s the only legacy you’ll leave."

Audience Reaction:

Boos intensify as his "respect" feels patronizing and manipulative. Fans hate that he gatekeeps honor, yet his legitimacy keeps them invested. When he loses, the arena erupts in shock—not joy—as they realize even his arrogance has limits.

Why It Works:
Viktor remains a despotic heel, but his warped nobility adds depth. He’s a tyrant who genuinely believes he’s cleansing the sport, making his rare moments of respect feel like twisted blessings. The crowd hates that he’s right about corruption—but hates him more for how he weaponizes truth.

Final Boss Energy, Evolved:
He’s a storm that weeds out the unworthy, leaving only those he deems "fit to kneel." And if you beat him? You’ve merely inherited his war.

My Reply: Okay persona fine, need to rewrite the description, he is like a street fighter. Wears t shirt and ripped jeans, talks like Hood, but he is a man of code and honor. And also kayfabe he is actually a lot smarter than he looks

DeepThink: Alright, let's tackle this. The user wants to revise Viktor Kane's persona to be more of a street fighter with a hood vibe, but still maintain his code of honor and intelligence. Let me start by understanding the key changes needed.
First, the original persona was a regal, aristocratic heel. Now, he needs to be a street fighter. So, the appearance changes from royal gear to a t-shirt and ripped jeans. The entrance theme and style should reflect a more urban, gritty feel. The name might need to be adjusted to something that sounds more street, like "V.K." instead of "The Sovereign."
Next, the user mentioned he talks like someone from the hood but is actually smarter than he looks. So, his mic work should blend street slang with hidden intelligence. Maybe he uses metaphors or references that show he's well-read, but it's subtle. Also, his code of honor needs to stay intact. He respects hard fighters, even if they lose, and despises cheaters.
The in-ring style should be more brawler but still technical. Since he's a street fighter, maybe incorporate moves that look rough but are calculated. His finishers could have names that reflect both street smarts and his code, like "Street Verdict" or "Codebreaker."
The catchphrases need to have a street edge but also hint at his intelligence. Phrases like "Play chess, not checkers" could work. His entrance should have elements that surprise the audience, like switching from a trap beat to classical music, showing his duality.
I need to ensure that his intelligence is part of his kayfabe. Maybe he outsmarts opponents in matches, using strategies that others don't expect. His feuds could involve him exposing "frauds" who underestimate him because of his appearance.
Also, the audience reaction should be mixed. They might boo his arrogance and street persona but respect his skills and intelligence. When he shows respect, it's grudging and in his own style, like a nod instead of a handshake.
Let me check if all elements are covered: street attire, hood talk, hidden intelligence, code of honor, in-ring style, and audience reaction. Need to tie it all together without losing the original essence of being a dominant, clean fighter who hates cheaters.
Make sure the moves reflect both brawling and technical skills. Maybe a mix of power moves and submissions. The finishers should be impactful and have names that resonate with his new persona.
Also, the feuds should highlight his intelligence. For example, he could outthink a technical wrestler or outmaneuver a powerhouse. His backstory could mention hustling on the streets but studying strategy, which explains his smarts.
Need to avoid stereotypes. Even though he's from the streets, he's not a thug. He's strategic and has a strict moral code. His intelligence is a key part of his character, so it should come through in his promos and actions.
Finally, the theme song should blend street elements with something unexpected, like classical music, to symbolize his hidden depth. The entrance routine can start with a hooded figure and then reveal a more calculated demeanor.
Alright, time to structure all this into the updated persona.

Hidden Genius: Subtly references Sun Tzu, Machiavelli, or chess strategy mid-promo. To a cocky Ivy League heel: "You got a degree? Good. I got a Ph.D. in Pain—thesis title: How I Folded You in Chapter 1."

Code of the Streets: Respects anyone who fights “straight-up,” even rookies. After beating a gutsy face: "You got heart. Shame heart don’t pay the bills." If he loses clean, he nods at the victor and mutters, "A’ight. You real. For now."

Final Boss Energy:
He’s the guardian of a code no one asked for—a hood oracle who’ll drag wrestling back to its roots, one brutal lesson at a time.

My Prompt: Now, I want a make storyline him vs fictional stable exactly like nWo. So the storyline is nWo tried to recruit him, but he is man of honor and has a lone wolf persona. 2 weeks later, he wins the championship, another 2 weeks later he lost the title against nWo leader, cause of cheating and interference and he was brutally beaten up by nWo. After months he returned from injury vow to dismantle the nWo forever. So every week he takes down nWo members one by one alone by himself , until the biggest ppv of the year, against all cheats and antics he wins the title again, and all this time he maintained his heel persona

AI Reply: Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants a storyline where Viktor Kane, now rebranded as V.K., faces a stable similar to the nWo. The key points are that the nWo tries to recruit him, but he refuses due to his honor and lone wolf persona. Then he wins the championship, loses it to the nWo leader due to cheating, gets injured, returns months later, and takes down each nWo member one by one, leading to a final PPV match where he regains the title while remaining a heel throughout.
First, I need to structure the storyline into phases. The original nWo storyline was about a dominant faction taking over, so this should mirror that but with V.K. as the anti-hero heel opposing them. The user specified specific time frames: 2 weeks to win the title, another 2 weeks to lose it, then months of absence before returning.
I should start with the recruitment attempt. Since V.K. is a lone wolf with a code, the nWo (let's call them something else, maybe "New World Carnage" or similar) would approach him, maybe during a promo or after a match. He refuses, leading to immediate heat. Then his title win should be clean, showcasing his dominance. The loss needs to involve cheating and interference, making the nWo look strong but underhanded. The beatdown should be brutal enough to write him off for a few months.
When he returns, the user wants him to dismantle the stable weekly. Each episode, he takes out a member, leading to the final PPV. Important to maintain his heel persona, so even when fighting against the nWo, he's still arrogant, maybe using underhanded tactics but within his code. The final match should have interference, but he overcomes it, winning cleanly but still as a heel.
I need to ensure that V.K.'s character remains consistent. He's a heel but with honor, so he doesn't cheat, but he's ruthless. His interactions with the nWo should highlight his code versus their lawlessness. The story should have escalating tension, with each victory over a member weakening the nWo. The final PPV should be a culmination where he outsmarts their cheating, maybe by forcing a no-DQ match or countering their tactics.
Also, the user mentioned that V.K. is smarter than he looks. So during his return, he should use strategy to take down each member, perhaps exploiting their weaknesses or using their own tactics against them. Maybe some promos where he references his street smarts and code, contrasting with the nWo's chaos.
Need to make sure the timeline fits: two weeks to win the title, two weeks to lose it, then months off. Upon return, weekly takedowns leading to the PPV. The finale at the biggest PPV of the year where he wins the title back despite the odds, maintaining his heel persona by perhaps showing disdain for the fans even in victory.
Potential plot points: Maybe the nWo leader is someone from his past, adding personal stakes. Or during his absence, the nWo has taken over the promotion, making his quest to dismantle them more urgent. Each week, V.K. could have matches with stipulations that prevent interference, or he could call out members in backstage segments, leading to impromptu fights.
In terms of audience reaction, they should still boo him, but maybe there's reluctant respect because he's taking down the hated nWo. However, his methods remain heelish—taunting, refusing help, arrogant promos. The key is that he's not turning face; he's still a heel but with a code that the audience can grudgingly respect.
I should also incorporate his intelligence. Maybe during the feud, he exposes the nWo's strategies in promos, or uses technical skills to counter their power moves. The final match could involve him outsmarting the leader, perhaps reversing a cheat attempt into his own finisher.
Lastly, the ending should solidify his heel status. Even after winning, he doesn't celebrate with the fans, maybe insults them or the promotion, setting up future feuds while closing this chapter with the nWo.

AI Reply: Wrestling Storyline: "Code vs. Chaos" – V.K. vs. The New World Carnage (nWo-inspired stable)

Phase 1: The Recruitment & Betrayal
Week 1:

nWo Parody Stable Name: The New World Carnage (NWC)

Leader: "The Architect" Cyrus Black (master manipulator, silver-tongued schemer).

Members: Brutal enforcer "Warhammer" Jax, high-flying opportunist "The Serpent" Silas, and femme fatale tech-genius Zara Vex.

Recruitment Pitch: After V.K. wins a brutal #1 contender’s match, the NWC surrounds the ring. Cyrus offers him a black-and-red armband (NWC’s symbol). "You’re a king in a land of clowns. Join us—we’ll burn it all."

V.K.’s Response: Snaps the armband, growls, "I don’t roll with tourists. Burn it yourself—I’ll roast marshmallows." Crowd jeers his defiance.

Week 2:

Title Win: V.K. defeats the reigning champ in a no-frills brawl, winning the title clean. Post-match, he stares down the NWC watching from the ramp, holding the belt high: "This ain’t gold—it’s a bullseye. Come get it."

Week 4:

Title Loss: V.K. vs. Cyrus Black ends in chaos. Zara hacks the arena lights; Silas low-blows V.K. under darkness. Cyrus hits a concealed blackjack, pins him. NWC beats V.K. post-match—Jax powerbombs him through the announce table. V.K. is stretchered out, title stolen.

Phase 2: The Exile
Months 1–3:

NWC dominates weekly shows, brainwashing midcarders into "Carnage Soldiers." Cyrus claims V.K. "died a hypocrite."

Vignettes: Shadowy clips of V.K. rehabbing in a gritty gym, muttering, "Y’all think I forgot? Nah. I’m curating the pain."

Phase 3: The Reckoning
Return Episode:

NWC is celebrating Cyrus’s "365-Day Reign of Terror" when V.K.’s trap remix of "Für Elise" hits. He storms in, chain wallet in hand, and wrecks a Carnage Soldier with a brainbuster. Mic drop: "I’m back to audit this circus. Payback’s due—with interest."

Weekly Take-Downs:

Week 1: V.K. baits Silas into a "No DQ" match, knowing Zara will interfere. He superkicks Zara, uses her laptop cord to choke Silas out: "Snake meet mongoose."

Week 2: Challenges Jax to a "Falls Count Anywhere" brawl. Lures him into a parking lot, blinds him with car headlights, then locks in the "Street Verdict" on the hood.

Week 3: Outsmarts Zara in a "Tech vs. Street" match. She tries to weaponize drones; V.K. hurls a trash can at her control panel, then chokes her out: "Delete yourself."

Promos:

V.K. mocks Cyrus: "You built a house of cards. I’m the hurricane."

Still a heel, he scoffs at fans chanting his name: "Y’all cheer me now? Should’ve cheered louder when I was carryin’ this trash company."

Phase 4: The Final War (At "Supreme Dominion," the Biggest PPV)
Stipulation: V.K. demands a "Carnage Rules" match (no DQ, no allies)—"You wanna cheat? Cheat. I’ll still break you."

Match Highlights:

Zara revives Silas/Jax to interfere, but V.K. neutralizes them with weaponized IQ: traps Jax in a forklift, handcuffs Silas to the guardrail.

Cyrus tries to flee; V.K. tackles him into the crowd, battering him with concession-stand trays.

Finish: Cyrus grabs the title belt to smash V.K., but V.K. ducks, hits "The Calculus" onto the belt. 1-2-3.

Post-Match: V.K. stands over Cyrus, title in hand. Crowd erupts—he spits on Cyrus, then snarls at fans: "This belt’s mine. Y’all still scrubs. Stay mad."

Why It Works:

Heel Integrity: V.K. never turns face. He’s still arrogant, still insults fans, but his war against corruption is his code—not theirs.

nWo Homage: NWC’s over-the-top cheating mirrors the nWo’s chaos, making V.K.’s lone-wolf takedowns feel revolutionary.

Final Boss Energy: Even in victory, V.K. remains wrestling’s antihero—a king who cleans up the streets but still hates the kingdom.

Post-Storyline:

V.K. enters a bitter feud with a rising face who accuses him of "becoming what you hate."

NWC remnants lurk, teasing a future "Carnage Reborn."

Theme Song Update: "Street Euclid" now includes distorted nWo-style guitar riffs during V.K.’s revenge arc.

Catchphrase to Close:
"You wanted a hero? Wrong neighborhood. I’m the judge, jury, and executioner."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My Prompt: Great, just add more memeber for nwc

DeepThink: Okay, so the user wants to add more members to the NWC stable. Let me start by recalling the existing members: Cyrus Black (leader), Jax, Silas, and Zara Vex. The user mentioned making it like the nWo, which had several members, so adding more makes sense.
First, I need to think about roles within the stable. The original nWo had various archetypes—leader, enforcer, tag team, etc. The current NWC has a leader, an enforcer, a high-flyer, and a tech expert. To expand, maybe add a tag team, a veteran, a wildcard, and a young star. This covers different wrestling styles and story possibilities.
Each new member should have a distinct gimmick that contrasts with V.K.'s lone wolf persona. Let's see:
1. **Tag Team**: A duo that can handle tag matches and add numbers. Maybe brothers for a cohesive backstory. "The Graveborn Twins" with a dark, occult theme. Their moves can be synchronized and spooky, fitting the chaos theme.
2. **Veteran**: Someone with experience who can mentor the group. "Iron" Mick Malone, a grizzlied brawler with a weaponized prosthetic arm. His veteran status adds credibility and a different fighting style.
3. **Wildcard**: An unpredictable member to cause chaos. "Riot" Rory Hayes, an anarchist with a punk look. Uses dirty tactics and can interfere in matches unpredictably.
4. **Young Star**: A rising talent manipulated by the leader. "The Prodigy" Evan Cross, a cocky young wrestler with technical skills. His betrayal of a mentor adds depth and future storyline potential.
Now, consider how these additions affect the storyline. Each new member can be introduced during V.K.'s weekly takedowns. For example, V.K. faces the Graveborns in a handicap match, uses Mick's prosthetic against him, outsmarts Rory's chaos, and exposes Evan's hypocrisy.
Need to ensure each member has a unique gimmick and role. Also, their interactions with V.K. should showcase his intelligence and code. Maybe V.K. uses their own tactics against them, maintaining his heel persona while dismantling the group.
Check if the new members fit the nWo vibe—larger-than-life, intimidating, and corrupt. Their entrances and promos should reflect the NWC's chaotic influence. Also, think about match stipulations that play to each member's strengths and how V.K. can counter them.
Finally, make sure the additions don't overshadow the original members but enhance the stable's threat level. Each new member provides a different challenge for V.K., keeping the storyline engaging and varied.

AI Reply: Expanded Stable: The New World Carnage (NWC)
(Now 8 Members – A Legion of Chaos)

New Additions to NWC:
5. "The Graveborn Twins" – Dante & Damien Graves

Gimmick: Creepy, silent tag team with a "raised from the dead" aesthetic. Wear tattered suits, face paint resembling cracked porcelain, and whisper in unison during promos.

Role: Cyrus’s personal hitmen. They never speak, only laugh eerily. Specialize in psychological warfare (e.g., turning off lights, leaving cryptic symbols at ringside).

Signature Move: "Séance Slam" (Simultaneous chokeslams onto opposing opponents, followed by a synchronized throat-slash taunt).

Story Purpose: V.K. mocks their theatrics: "Y’all ain’t ghosts—you’re Halloween store rejects." Defeats them in a Casket Match by padlocking both inside… only for them to "vanish" and reappear later.

*6. "Iron" Mick Malone

Gimmick: Grizzled, 20-year veteran with a prosthetic left arm (conceals brass knuckles or a blade). Claims he "built this industry" and resents V.K. for disrespecting tradition.

Role: NWC’s "Old Guard." Uses veteran tricks (eye gouges, hidden weapons) and berates younger members for being soft.

Signature Move: "Scrapyard Driver" (A piledriver onto a steel chair).

Story Purpose: V.K. outsmarts him by disabling his prosthetic arm mid-match, then taunts: "Time to retire that fossil."

7. "Riot" Rory Hayes

Gimmick: Unhinged anarchist in a tattered gas mask, obsessed with "burning the system." Caries a Molotov cocktail prop to the ring (filled with colored water for "fire" spots).

Role: Wildcard chaos agent. Attacks random wrestlers/fans to "prove the world is corrupt."

Signature Move: "System Crash" (A diving elbow drop onto a weapon-covered opponent).

Story Purpose: V.K. traps him in a Straightjacket Match, mocking his "fake rebellion": "You wanna riot? Riot this."

8. "The Prodigy" Evan Cross

Gimmick: Cocky 22-year-old "golden boy" with a Ivy League pedigree (wears a letterman jacket to the ring). Claims he joined NWC to "disrupt the status quo."

Role: Cyrus’s "protege." Uses technical wrestling but cheats arrogantly (e.g., faking injuries, hiding leverage objects in his jacket).

Signature Move: "Trust Fund Breaker" (A figure-four leglock with a rollup pin while grabbing the ropes).

Story Purpose: V.K. exposes him as a "daddy’s boy" by hacking his social media mid-promo, revealing Evan’s privileged upbringing. Humiliates him in a Loser Leaves NWC Match.

Updated Storyline Beats with Expanded NWC:
Week 4 (Post-Title Loss): After V.K. is beaten down, the full NWC surrounds the ring. Cyrus declares: "This isn’t a stable—it’s a plague. And you’re patient zero." The Graves Twins place a black rose on V.K.’s chest as the faction poses over his body.

Exile Phase: NWC’s new members run wild:

Rory Hayes "firebombs" the announce desk weekly.

Evan Cross steals wins from fan favorites, bragging about his "revolutionary IQ."

Mick Malone corrupts a beloved legend into joining NWC.

Reckoning Phase:

Graves Twins: V.K. lures them into a Pitch Black Match, uses glow-in-the-dark face paint to mock their gimmick, then beats them with a shovel (a nod to their "grave" gimmick).

Mick Malone: V.K. sabotages his prosthetic arm with a magnetized turnbuckle, leading to Mick accidentally knocking out Cyrus.

Rory Hayes: V.K. "arrests" him mid-riot with a fake cop gimmick, handcuffing him to the ring post.

Evan Cross: V.K. challenges him to a No Ropes, No Rules match, dismantling his technical style with street brawling. Post-match, he tears Evan’s jacket: "Your legacy’s threadbare, kid."

PPV Climax: At Supreme Dominion, V.K. faces all 8 NWC members in a gauntlet-style Carnage Rules match. He survives chaos by:

Using Zara’s drones against her.

Tricking Jax into spearing Cyrus.

Finally pinning Cyrus after a Street Verdict onto shattered glass.

Why It Works:

The expanded NWC feels like an unstoppable empire, making V.K.’s lone-wolf dismantling mythic.

Each member represents a different "corruption" (tradition, anarchy, privilege), letting V.K. attack systemic rot while staying a selfish heel.

Fans hate that V.K. is right about NWC’s fakeness… but still boo him for gatekeeping "realness."

Post-PPV:

NWC fractures into splinter groups (e.g., Graves Twins form a occult tag team, Rory becomes a solo anarchist).

V.K. tosses the title in a trash can post-win: "This was never the prize. The prize was watchin’ you burn."

Final Catchphrase:
"Y’all wanted a war? I’m the whole damn battlefield."

My Prompt: Need add a survivor series type pov, where vk got ambushed by the nwc when other wrestler heels and face alike came to help him, cause they once were also victim of nwc and hates them, this event caused a chain reaction to have 20 men war games at the ppv weeks to go by.

 This events happens before the championship match at the biggest ppv

DeepThink: Okay, let's tackle this user's request. They want to add a Survivor Series-style event where V.K. is ambushed by the NWC, and both heels and faces come to help him, leading to a 20-man War Games match at the PPV before the championship bout. 
First, I need to integrate this new phase into the existing storyline without conflicting with previous elements. The user mentioned this happens before the championship match at the biggest PPV, so I'll need to adjust the timeline accordingly. 
The key points here are:
1. V.K. gets ambushed by the expanded NWC.
2. Other wrestlers, both heels and faces, who were previous victims of NWC, come to his aid.
3. This leads to a 20-man War Games match at the PPV, which is a precursor to the final championship match.
I should start by setting up the ambush. Since the NWC has 8 members, the ambush needs to be overwhelming. Maybe during a segment where V.K. is cutting a promo, the NWC attacks him. Then, other wrestlers who have grudges against NWC rush in to help. This creates an organic reason for heels and faces to unite against a common enemy.
Next, I need to establish why these other wrestlers would help V.K., especially since he's a heel. The user mentioned they were also victims of NWC. So, each helping wrestler should have a history with NWC—maybe they lost matches due to interference, were injured, or humiliated. This shared vendetta justifies their alliance despite alignment differences.
For the War Games match, I need to structure teams. The user wants 20 men, which is a large number. With NWC having 8 members, the opposing team would need 12 wrestlers (since War Games is usually two teams). But 20 is a lot, so maybe it's a multi-team War Games or a battle royal variation. Alternatively, it could be a 10 vs. 10 match. Wait, Survivor Series is typically 5 vs. 5, but War Games can vary. Maybe the user wants a massive match, so 10 vs. 10 with 20 participants. That makes sense.
I need to create a reason for the match to happen. The ambush leads to a chaotic brawl, prompting the GM to sanction a War Games match to settle the score. This builds tension leading into the PPV. The War Games match would be the main event before the championship match, where V.K. finally faces Cyrus Black again.
I also need to maintain V.K.'s heel persona. Even though others help him, he doesn't turn face. He might be reluctant to accept help, or he uses the situation to his advantage. Post-match, he could betray the alliance, reinforcing his heel status.
Potential story beats:
- Ambush scene with NWC attacking V.K.
- Surprise saves from unexpected allies (both faces and heels).
- Backstage segments where wrestlers agree to unite against NWC.
- Tensions within the alliance due to conflicting alignments.
- War Games match where the alliance barely works together to defeat NWC.
- Aftermath leading into the championship match, with V.K. still as a heel.
I need to make sure the user's original elements are preserved: V.K. remains a heel, the championship match happens after War Games, and the storyline maintains the lone wolf vs. corrupt stable dynamic.
Possible challenges:
- Balancing the large number of participants in War Games without overshadowing V.K.'s role.
- Ensuring the alliance makes sense in the context of existing storylines.
- Keeping V.K.'s character consistent despite receiving help.
Solutions:
- Highlight key moments in the War Games where V.K. takes down major NWC members, reinforcing his dominance.
- Use existing rivalries between the alliance members and NWC to justify their participation.
- Show V.K. as pragmatic, accepting help only to achieve his goal, not out of camaraderie.
This addition should enhance the storyline by showing the broader impact of NWC's corruption and setting up a climactic battle that elevates V.K.'s status as a dominant heel.

Phase 5: The Ambush – "Enemy of My Enemy"
Week 4 (Post-Exile Return):

Segment: V.K. cuts a promo calling out Cyrus Black, demanding his title rematch. Mid-rant, the full NWC (8 members) storms the ring, surrounding him. Cyrus sneers: "You think you’re the hero? You’re just another corpse in our revolution."

Cavalry Arrives: Suddenly, 4 heels and 4 faces rush the ring, attacking NWC with weapons:

Faces: A beloved high-flyer (NWC cost him a title shot), a grizzled technician (NWC injured his protégé), a fiery underdog (humiliated by Evan Cross), and a fan-favorite tag team (forced to disband after NWC interference).

Heels: A cocky loner (NWC stole his paycheck), a brutal monster (NWC framed him for a backstage attack), a manipulative manager (NWC ruined his "clients"), and a veteran (NWC mocked his legacy).

Chaos Ensues: The brawl spills into the crowd. V.K., bloodied but smirking, grabs a mic: "Y’all hate me more than them? Pathetic. But tonight? Tonight, we burn."

Phase 6: The Alliance – "Temporary Truce"

Match Highlights:

Structure: 5-on-5 start, alternating entrants every 2 minutes.

Key Moments:

The monster heel turns on his own team early, attacking the fan-favorite tag team—until V.K. blasts him with a steel chair: "I hate traitors more than morons."

Cyrus Black and V.K. finally collide, sparking a brutal fistfight.

Finish: With only V.K. and Cyrus left, V.K. counters Cyrus’s blackjack shot, hitting "The Calculus" off the top rope onto a weapon pile. Pinfall.

NWC remnants watch from the ramp, seething. V.K. smirks: "Y’all next."

Why It Works:

Heel Integrity Intact: V.K. stays a selfish loner, using the alliance as tools. Fans hate that he’s ungrateful but respect his brutal honesty.

nWo Nostalgia+: The 20-person War Games mirrors nWo’s faction dominance, while V.K.’s lone-wolf defiance channels Stone Cold’s anti-authority—but with a streetwise edge.

Legacy Building: The War Games win elevates V.K. as a force of nature, making his eventual title victory feel earned yet still villainous.

Final Scene:
V.K. leaves the arena, title slung over his shoulder, as NWC’s theme plays distorted in the background. The camera lingers on a backstage wall spray-painted with: "THE CODE IS LAW – V.K."

Catchphrase to Close:
"You can’t kill a king. You can only make him angrier."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My Prompt: Grear storyline. One thing I wanted add in this saga. How in orignal life, nWo were recruting many people as the could and those reluctant to join were beaten, I want to add this here

DeepThink: Okay, let's see. The user wants to incorporate the aspect where NWC, similar to the original nWo, actively recruits wrestlers and beats those who refuse. This is a key element in the nWo's dominance and their reputation for bullying.
First, I need to integrate this into the existing storyline without conflicting with the previous phases. The original nWo storyline had members recruiting others aggressively, so I need to mirror that here. The user mentioned that reluctant wrestlers were beaten, which adds to the chaos and fear in the storyline.
I should start by creating recruitment segments where NWC approaches various wrestlers. These segments can show NWC's power and intimidation tactics. When a wrestler refuses, NWC attacks them, establishing their ruthlessness. This will also explain why other wrestlers later help V.K. during the ambush – they've all been victims of NWC's recruitment violence.
Next, I need to tie these recruitment beatdowns into the existing narrative. For example, before the Survivor Series-style ambush, there could be a series of incidents where NWC targets different wrestlers. This builds tension and justifies why both faces and heels unite against NWC despite their differences.
I also need to ensure that V.K.'s character remains consistent. He's a heel but with a code of honor. Maybe he comments on NWC's methods, further highlighting his own principles. His refusal to join NWC should be a pivotal moment, reinforcing his lone wolf persona.
Adding specific matches or backstage segments where recruitment attempts happen will make the storyline richer. Maybe a mid-card wrestler gets approached, refuses, and gets beaten down. This can happen over several weeks, showing the pattern of NWC's aggression.
Also, the user wants this to happen before the championship match at the biggest PPV. So these recruitment and beatdown events should occur during the earlier phases, leading up to the Survivor Series ambush. This way, when the other wrestlers come to help V.K., it's a culmination of their shared suffering under NWC.
I should also consider how these new elements affect the War Games match. The wrestlers who were beaten by NWC now have a personal stake in the fight, making the alliance more believable. It adds emotional depth to the conflict.
Finally, ensuring that all these elements tie back to V.K.'s ultimate victory and maintaining his heel persona. Even as others unite, V.K. stays true to his code, not becoming a traditional hero but still opposing the greater evil of NWC.

AI Reply: Expanded Storyline: NWC’s Recruitment Reign of Terror
(Integrating the nWo-Style Recruitment & Beatdowns)

New Phase: The NWC Recruitment Campaign
Week 1–3 (Pre-Ambush):

Segments: The NWC begins targeting midcarders, rookies, and veterans with "offers" to join their "revolution."

Example 1: NWC invades a backstage interview with a rising face. Cyrus Black tosses them a black armband: "Join us, or become collateral damage." When the face refuses, the Graves Twins attack, leaving them bloodied with the armband stapled to their chest.

Example 2: "Iron" Mick Malone corners a veteran heel in the parking lot: "You’re obsolete. But with us? You’ll die relevant." The vet spits in his face—NWC beats him down, spray-painting "WASHED" on his car.

Example 3: Zara Vex hacks a jobber’s social media, posting "I AM NWC" before Rory Hayes ambushes them during a match, "firebombing" their entrance gear.

Key Moment:

A beloved underdog (future ally of V.K.) rejects Cyrus’s offer live on mic: "I’d rather flip burgers than sell my soul!" NWC’s Jax powerbombs him through a merch table. Cyrus coldly states: "Pride is the first step to the grave."

Impact on the Roster:
Fear & Paranoia: Wrestlers begin wearing NWC armbands preemptively to avoid attacks, only for Cyrus to mock them: "You wear our colors out of fear. You’re not worthy."

Heel/Face Unity: Backstage segments show bitter rivals bonding over shared NWC trauma:

A cocky heel warns a face: "Watch your back. Cyrus’s dogs are hungry."

A face reluctantly lends a veteran heel ice packs after an NWC beatdown.

Integration into V.K.’s Story:
Week 2 (Pre-Title Win):

NWC tries recruiting V.K. earlier, during a backstage brawl. Cyrus offers him a black armband: "The streets made you. We’ll make you a god."

V.K. scoffs, shredding the armband: "Gods don’t cheat. They crush." This sparks their initial rivalry.

Week 3: After V.K. wins the title, NWC beats down a jobber during his celebration, forcing V.K. to watch. Cyrus taunts: "This is your kingdom? Pathetic."

Phase 5 (Revised): The Ambush & Cavalry
Context: By the time NWC ambushes V.K., the roster is a powder keg of resentment.

Expanded Ambush Scene:

When the 4 faces and 4 heels rush the ring, each has a specific NWC vendetta:

Face 1: "You put my brother in the hospital!" (Attacks Zara Vex)

Heel 1: "You torched my Bentley!" (Chokes Evan Cross with his own jacket)

Veteran Face: "I’ll retire when I say so!" (Brawls with Mick Malone)

V.K. watches the chaos, sneering: "Y’all finally grew a spine? ’Bout time."

New Matches/Feuds Pre-War Games:
"NWC Recruitment Trial" Match:

A wrestler forced to fight 3 NWC members in a gauntlet. If they survive, they’re "worthy." If not, they’re branded with NWC spray paint.

"Armband on a Pole" Match:

Loser must wear the NWC armband for a month. Faces throw it in the trash; heels use it to manipulate NWC.

War Games Fallout:
Catharsis: During the match, allies target specific NWC members who wronged them:

The underdog who rejected Cyrus dives onto him from the cage.

The veteran face powerbombs Mick Malone onto his own prosthetic arm.

V.K.’s Heel Reaction: Post-match, he robs a heel ally’s victory moment by stealing their finisher on a NWC mercenary: "Credit where it’s due."

Why It Works:
nWO Authenticity**: NWC’s recruitment terror mirrors the nWo’s "Too Sweet or Die" ethos, making their dominance feel suffocating.

Depth for Allies: The rescuers aren’t random—they’re victims with visceral grudges, justifying the uneasy alliance.

V.K.’s Consistency: He never pities the victims ("Should’ve fought harder") but respects their rage ("Hate’s a good motivator").

Final Touch:

PPV Vignette: A montage plays before the title match showing NWC’s recruitment spree, ending with V.K. staring into the camera: "You recruited an army. I am the army."

Catchphrase Addition:
"NWC’s a gang. I’m a one-man genocide."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My Prompt: The final ppv, where it ends all. It's wrestlmania style pay per view. Basically nwc vs whole roster. For example nwc members tag team champion they have to face beloved tag team. Personal rivalry matches. Midcard title matches and finally the nwc. The promo where it all ends

DeepThink: Okay, the user wants a grand finale at a WrestleMania-style PPV where the entire roster faces off against the NWC. Let me break down what they need. They mentioned tag titles, midcard titles, personal rivalries, and the final showdown.
First, I need to structure the event with multiple matches, each targeting different NWC members. The user wants every title and rivalry resolved here. I should start with the opening match to set the tone, maybe the tag team titles. The beloved team vs. the Graves Twins makes sense since they're creepy and undefeated. A Buried Alive match adds drama.
Next, midcard titles. Evan Cross, the golden boy, has the midcard title. Pairing him with a veteran face like Mick Foley's style could work. A 2-out-of-3 Falls match would showcase technical skills and storytelling.
Personal rivalries: Rory Hayes, the anarchist, against the underdog he injured. A Street Fight with fire spots would fit his character. Then Zara Vex, the tech genius, against the high-flyer. A Cybernetic Steel Cage match with tech vs. agility.
For the Women's Championship, the femme fatale vs. a resilient face. A submission match with interference from Zara, but the face overcomes it.
The main event: V.K. vs. Cyrus Black in a Hell in a Cell match. All NWC members banned from ringside. Brutal spots, callbacks to previous matches, and V.K. winning clean but staying heel.
Post-match, the roster comes out to acknowledge V.K., but he rejects them, maintaining his heel persona. The NWC disbands, members leave or get arrested. Final shot of V.K. with the title, spray painting his motto.
Promo package before the main event to recap the saga. Catchphrases to emphasize V.K.'s character. Make sure each match ties up loose ends and the event feels epic. Need to ensure V.K. remains a heel despite the victory, staying true to his persona.

Story: Zara hacked Luna’s flight tracker, causing a career-threatening injury.

Match: Cage rigged with Zara’s drones and laser tripwires. Luna dodges tech traps, leaps from drones to hit a 450 Splash.

Finish: Luna escapes the cage, Zara screams as her own drones short-circuit and "arrest" her via taser cuffs.

Women’s Championship – Submission Match
Zara’s Protégé: "The Black Widow" Nyx (NWC) vs. Sara "The Heartbeat" Cole (Face)

Story: Nyx infiltrated the division as Zara’s "project," injuring fan favorites.

Finish: Sara endures Nyx’s Venom Lock, reverses into a Sharpshooter while Zara hacks the jumbotron to distract. Sara wins, Nyx’s mask ripped off to reveal Zara’s mind-control chip.

Final Scene:
The camera pans over the destroyed ring, NWC gear littered everywhere. The roster stands united, watching V.K. exit.

Vignette: A lone spotlight hits the stage wall, now spray-painted with: "THE CODE IS LAW – V.K."

Theme Song: "Street Euclid" plays distorted as pyro explodes.

My Prompt: How will, Jim ross and jerry the king would call the pre event call. Like give us run down of the summary of prior events and what are fans to expect

DeepThink: Okay, the user wants a pre-event rundown by Jim Ross and Jerry "The King" Lawler, summarizing the prior events and setting expectations for the big PPV. Let me start by recalling the storyline so far. The user has developed a wrestling persona named V.K., who's a heel with a code of honor, facing off against the NWC, an nWo-like stable. The storyline has built up to a WrestleMania-style event called "Reckoning Day" where the entire roster takes on the NWC in various matches.
First, I need to capture the essence of how Jim Ross and Jerry Lawler would present this. Jim Ross is known for his passionate, storytelling style, while Lawler adds color commentary with a bit of heelish flair. They should recap the key events: the formation of NWC, their recruitment tactics, V.K.'s resistance, the War Games match, and the lead-up to the final PPV.
I should mention each major match on the card, tying them back to the ongoing feuds. For example, the tag team match with The Brotherhood vs. The Graves Twins, the midcard title match, the grudge street fight, the women's championship, and the Hell in a Cell main event. Each match has its own story that needs a brief explanation.
Also, the user wants the announcers to highlight the stakes: the end of NWC, V.K.'s potential triumph, and the unity of the roster against the common enemy. They should build excitement, maybe hinting at possible outcomes without giving away the results. Including some catchphrases from the characters would add authenticity.
Need to make sure the dialogue sounds natural, like a real wrestling commentary team. Jim Ross would emphasize the emotional weight and history, while Lawler might downplay the faces or support the heels a bit. They should also mention the implications of each match, like titles changing hands or personal vendettas being settled.
Finally, wrap it up with a strong closing line that hypes the event, something that gives goosebumps and makes the audience eager to watch. Make sure to reference the "Reckoning Day" theme and the overarching narrative of code versus chaos.

AI Reply: Pre-Event Commentary Segment:
The camera pans to Jim Ross and Jerry "The King" Lawler at the commentary desk, surrounded by pyro explosions and a roaring crowd. The graphic for "Reckoning Day" flashes on the titantron.

Jim Ross (Gravely Serious):
"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Reckoning Day—a night etched in blood, sweat, and vengeance! For months, the New World Carnage has terrorized this roster, recruitin’ souls and crushin’ spirits. But tonight, the hunted become the hunters! The King, this is more than a pay-per-view… it’s a reckonin’!"

Jerry "The King" Lawler (Smirking):
"Aw, c’mon, JR! You make it sound like some Shakespeare tragedy! Let’s not forget—V.K.’s no saint either. He’s a street thug who’s used everybody to get here! But hey, if the NWC’s gonna burn, I’ll bring the popcorn!"

JR (Ignoring King’s Jab):
"Let’s break it down, folks. The Brotherhood, a team nearly destroyed by the Graves Twins’ mind games, get their shot at the tag titles tonight. And let me tell ya—those Twins ain’t just creepy, they’re deadly. But The Brotherhood’s got heart, King. Heart that’s been forged in fire!"

King (Mocking):
"Heart? JR, The Brotherhood couldn’t find their hearts if they had a GPS! But hey, maybe they’ll get lucky and the Twins’ll trip over their own capes!"

JR (Steamrolling):
"Later tonight, ‘The Iron Will’ Hank Briggs faces that arrogant punk Evan Cross for the midcard title. Cross has disrespected legends, cheated his way to the top—but Hank’s a man who’s earned his stripes. And what about Rory Hayes and Jamie Vega? That street fight’s personal, King. Rory tried to blind Jamie, and tonight… Jamie’s bringin’ the fire literally!"

King (Chuckling):
"Jamie’s a human sparkler, JR! But Rory? That man’s a walking arson charge! And don’t forget Zara Vex—she’s got more gadgets than a Bond villain! Luna Vega better hope her high-flyin’ doesn’t end up as drone target practice!"

JR (Intensifying):
"And then there’s the Hell in a Cell main event! V.K. versus Cyrus Black—the war that’s consumed this company! Cyrus built an empire on lies, but V.K.? He’s a storm in boots, King! A man who’d rather die than kneel!"

King (Raising Eyebrow):
"Let’s be real, JR—V.K.’s no hero. He’s using this ‘code’ of his to hide that he’s just as vicious as the NWC! But hey, if he wants to play martyr? I’ll play along… till he stabs someone in the back!"

JR (Voice Cracking):
"Tonight isn’t about heroes or villains, King—it’s about survival! The NWC’s reign of terror ends here. Will V.K. cement his legacy? Will the roster finally stand united? Or will chaos consume us all?! Buckle up, folks—Reckoning Day is here!"

King (Grinning):
"Prediction time, JR! I say the NWC’s not done yet. Cyrus’ll slither outta that Cell like the snake he is, and V.K.? He’ll be left wonderin’ why he ever left the streets!"

JR (Final Passion):
"One thing’s certain, King—tonight, the code of the streets collides with the corruption of kings. Strap in, world… this is Reckoning Day!"

The camera cuts to the opening pyro as the crowd roars, the commentators’ voices fading into the electric hum of anticipation.

Final Line (JR Voiceover Over Montage):
"Decades from now, they’ll ask—did courage conquer carnage? Tune in, and witness history… forged in fury."

My Prompt: So during the final, match. Even though nwc was banned from entering ringside, they were causing trouble backstage so vk would get distracted and lose. The distraction was caused by the underlings of the faction, but they all were beaten by the remaining wrestler who were not recruited by nwc

DeepThink: Okay, let me try to process this. The user is building a wrestling storyline where the main event is V.K. versus Cyrus Black in a Hell in a Cell match. Even though NWC members are banned from ringside, they cause trouble backstage to distract V.K. But the other wrestlers who weren't recruited by NWC intervene and stop them. The user wants to integrate this into the final match at the PPV.
First, I need to recall the previous storyline elements. V.K. is a heel with a code of honor, leading up to a big showdown with the NWC faction. The final match is supposed to be the climax where V.K. overcomes the leader, Cyrus, despite interference. The twist here is that even though NWC is banned from ringside, they try to cause chaos backstage. However, other wrestlers step in to stop them, allowing V.K. to focus on the match.
I should structure the match to highlight the chaos backstage without direct interference in the ring. Maybe have moments where V.K. notices commotion but remains focused because the roster handles it. The key points are:
1. NWC underlings causing backstage distractions.
2. Faces and heels who were victims of NWC stopping them.
3. V.K. stays focused and defeats Cyrus cleanly.
Need to create specific spots where the backstage chaos is shown, but the other wrestlers thwart the interference. This reinforces the unity of the roster against NWC and V.K.'s determination. Also, maintaining V.K.'s heel persona by not acknowledging the help, maybe even dismissing it.
Possible segments: Backstage brawls, cutaways during the match showing the roster fighting NWC members, V.K. using the distraction to his advantage but not giving credit. The finish should be decisive, with V.K. winning despite the attempted distractions. Post-match, V.K. remains a heel, not thanking anyone, maybe even berating the roster for interfering.
Also, need to tie this into the commentary by JR and King, emphasizing the roster's unity and V.K.'s relentless focus. The ending should leave NWC dismantled, V.K. as champion, but still a heel.

My Prompt: Next day a defeated Cyrus scolds nwc, but seeing how badly they were treated, everyone left one by one leaving Cyrus alone to get beaten by, his previous tag team member who Cyrus broke the leg

DeepThink: Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to add a scene where, the day after the big PPV event, the defeated leader of the NWC, Cyrus Black, scolds his remaining faction members. However, seeing how badly they were treated by Cyrus, the members leave one by one. Then, Cyrus is left alone and gets beaten up by his former tag team partner, whom Cyrus had previously injured by breaking their leg. 
First, I need to make sure this fits into the existing storyline. The previous segments established that the NWC has been defeated at "Reckoning Day," with members either arrested, injured, or disbanded. Now, the next day, Cyrus is trying to regroup but faces rebellion from his own faction. 
I should start by setting the scene: maybe a backstage area where Cyrus is trying to rally the remaining NWC members. But the members are disillusioned because of how Cyrus treated them as expendable. Each member leaves, showing their reasons. Then, the former tag partner, who had been wronged by Cyrus, arrives for revenge.
I need to remember that V.K. is the main heel, but this scene focuses on Cyrus's downfall. The former tag partner could be a face or a returning character who has a history with Cyrus. The beatdown should be cathartic, showing Cyrus getting his comeuppance.
Potential elements to include:
- Cyrus's desperation and anger.
- Each NWC member's reason for leaving (e.g., Mick Malone's arm injury, Zara's failed tech, etc.).
- The arrival of the former partner, maybe using a weapon related to their injury (like a steel chair to the leg).
- A final moment where Cyrus is left broken, symbolizing the end of NWC.
I should also consider how this affects future storylines. Maybe the former partner becomes a new contender or aligns with V.K. temporarily. Or this could lead to a new feud if Cyrus returns later.
Need to ensure consistency with previous character motivations and maintain the gritty, streetwise tone established for V.K. and the NWC. Also, the dialogue should reflect each character's personality, like Cyrus's manipulative nature and the members' resentment.
Possible catchphrases during the beatdown, like the former partner saying, "This is for the leg you broke!" to tie back to their history. 
Make sure the scene is impactful but doesn't overshadow V.K.'s ongoing reign. It should serve as closure for the NWC storyline while setting up future angles.

AI Reply: Segment: "The Fall of a King" – Post-Reckoning Day Backstage Breakdown*

Scene 1: Cyrus’s Last Stand
Setting: A dimly lit locker room, littered with NWC gear and broken monitors. The remaining NWC members (Jax, Mick Malone, Zara Vex) sit battered, nursing injuries. Cyrus storms in, limping, his suit torn and face bloodied.

Cyrus (Screaming):
"This is what you call a plague?! You let a street rat and a bunch of has-beens dismantle us?! You’re all WEAK! PATHETIC! I should’ve left you rotting in the gutters where I found you!"

Zara Vex (Cold, Detaching Her Tech Gear):
"Weak? You blew our entire operation chasing your ego. Hack this." She tosses her NWC armband at his feet and walks out.

Cyrus (Spitting):
"Go crawl back to your mom’s basement, you code-jockey FAILURE!"

Scene 2: The Exodus
Mick Malone (Ripping Off His Prosthetic Arm):
"You promised me glory. All I got was this." He slams the arm on a table, revealing hidden blades. "I’m done bein’ your puppet. Keep the scrap metal."

Cyrus (Desperate):
"You’d be NOTHING without me, Malone! NOTHING!"

Jax (Silent, Until Now):
"…You broke us. For what?" He crushes his NWC armband in his fist and leaves.

Cyrus (Alone, Whispering):
"Fine. All of you… fine. I’ll rebuild. I’ll—"

Scene 3: The Reckoning
Enter: Derek "Ironfoot" Cole—Cyrus’s former tag partner, limping with a steel cane. His leg brace clanks ominously.

Derek (Calm, Deadly):
"Remember this, Cyrus? You said breaking my leg was ‘business.’ Let’s talk business."

Cyrus (Backing Up):
"Derek—wait! I had no choice! The faction needed—"

Derek (Swinging the Cane):
"The faction’s GONE. Now it’s just us."

The Beatdown:
Derek cracks the cane across Cyrus’s knee, mirroring his own injury.

Cyrus collapses, screaming, as Derek methodically destroys the NWC throne prop.

Finishing Move: Derek wraps Cyrus’s bad leg in a chair, stomping it with his braced boot. "How’s the ROI on that, partner?"

Final Shot:
Cyrus crawls toward the exit, clutching his leg, as Derek tosses the NWC crown into a trash can.

Derek (To Camera):
"The king is dead. But the throne’s still empty… and I’ve got unfinished business."

Epilogue:

Next Week: Derek confronts V.K., cane in hand: "You ended Cyrus. But this leg? It’s your problem now."

Cyrus’s Fate: Vanishes from TV, later hinted to be rehabbing in Mexico, plotting a return with a new "Carnage International" faction.

Why It Works:

Poetic Justice: Cyrus’s abuse of power destroys him, tying back to his "ends justify the means" ethos.

New Rivalry: Derek’s vendetta shifts to V.K., blending street-code honor with personal vengeance.

Legacy of NWC: The crown in the trash becomes a recurring visual symbol—power is fleeting.

Catchphrase to End the Scene:
"You don’t break legs, Cyrus. You break legacies." – Derek Cole

My Prompt: Okay, now. We need to create the storyline for rise of vk, before his feud with nwc

DeepThink: Alright, let's tackle creating the rise of V.K. before his feud with the NWC. The user wants to establish his backstory and how he built his reputation as a dominant heel with a code of honor. 
First, I need to outline V.K.'s origins. Since he's a street fighter with a hood persona but secretly smart, his background should reflect that. Maybe he comes from a tough neighborhood, learned to fight early, and uses street smarts to outthink opponents. His intelligence should be a key part of his strategy, not just brute strength.
Next, his initial feuds. These should showcase his skills and code. He should target wrestlers who cheat or disrespect the business. Perhaps he starts in the indie circuit, gaining a rep for beating cheaters clean. His early victories establish him as a threat. 
Then, how does he get noticed by the main roster? Maybe he wins a tournament or a high-profile match against a veteran. His mic skills are important here. He needs catchphrases that mix street slang with intellectual references, showing he's not just a thug.
His first major feud in the big league should test his code. Maybe he faces a corrupt authority figure or a faction that uses underhanded tactics. This feud solidifies his lone wolf persona. He refuses help, wins clean, but remains a heel because of his arrogance and disdain for the fans.
Including moments where he shows respect to worthy opponents, even in defeat, adds depth. Maybe he loses a match fairly and acknowledges the opponent, but still belittles the audience. This keeps him a heel but with layers.
I should also think about his visual presentation. Street clothes, maybe a chain or something symbolic. His entrance music and mannerisms should reflect his dual nature—streetwise but calculating.
Potential plot points: 
- A rivalry with a veteran who underestimates him, leading to V.K. outsmarting them.
- A tournament arc where he dominates but clashes with the establishment.
- A betrayal angle where someone tries to recruit him early on, but he refuses, setting up his later conflict with the NWC.
Ensuring continuity with his later feud with NWC is key. Maybe seeds are planted where he dismisses the idea of factions, preferring to work alone. His intelligence helps him anticipate opponents' moves, which later helps against NWC's tricks.
Need to balance his heel traits—arrogance, disrespect—with honorable actions like refusing to cheat. This makes him a complex character the audience loves to hate but respects.
Finally, his rise should culminate in a championship win, establishing him as a top heel before the NWC storyline begins. This title win would be clean, showcasing his dominance and setting the stage for NWC to target him as a threat.
