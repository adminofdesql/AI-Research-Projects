### Introduction

People have used AI to generate stories ever since the technology became publicly available. One of the main issues with this feature has been incoherent and inconsistent storytelling that differs from what the user expects. So, instead of the traditional approach to story generation, I have undertaken a project to test how absurd an AI's imagination can be when tasked with generating a slapstick, absurd world.

### The Absurd Concept

Absurd worldbuilding in pop culture is not uncommon; rather, the foundations of such concepts have been abundant since the early popularization of comedy. Prime modern examples of these ideas are found in popular cartoon shows. Examples include *Regular Show*, *The Amazing World of Gumball*, and *Rick and Morty*.

However, when generating a coherent and consistent story, users usually avoid such methods to keep things on track. In my research, I took the opposite approach. I wanted to see if, amidst all the chaos, an AI could handle generating a complete story of this nature while maintaining as much consistency and coherence as possible.

### How to Approach

As stated previously, users typically avoid generating plots with these absurd concepts. This led me to the challenge of how to build a story of this nature and guide it thoroughly.

The solution was to adopt the "zero-to-one-hundred" escalation model seen in the Cartoon Network show *Regular Show*. The show is often praised for its method of unfolding events through absurd plot escalations.

My next crucial step was to give the characters quirky personalities, exaggerating them as much as possible while grounding them with some realistic traits. This approach formed the foundation of my worldbuilding.

To generate the full story, I proceeded chapter by chapter, explicitly stating the events for each specific chapter. This process was straightforward, although developing the detailed plot for each chapter was challenging and required a long brainstorming session. This ensured the chapter layout coherently followed the complete plot from beginning to end.

### Result

After extensive worldbuilding and creating a chapter-by-chapter plot, I was able to generate a story that perfectly captures the nature of such a premise. All the while, I ensured the AI followed my commands to minimize plot holes, maintaining the plot's tone and the dynamics between the characters. Please see the attached PDF for the final story.

### Problems

One of the major, recurring flaws with the AI was its repetitive narration and its tendency to mix up current events with previous ones. These issues required additional, corrective prompts to fix.

The AI's narrative repetition was annoying in some parts. It is important to note that this project was intended to build a summary or a detailed outline of a potential story, not the final, full version.

Fixing these issues is a real challenge. Achieving the most satisfactory results would require an extensive amount of thought to develop the right prompts. While these issues are minor, they are noticeable. Leaving them unaddressed can make the narrative feel dull, whereas correcting them would significantly improve the story.

### Conclusion

Generating an absurd story or situation with AI is not just highly possible; it is quite common. However, maintaining narrative tracking and ensuring it remains coherent is the biggest challenge. This task requires extensive testing and a significant time investment, which is why most users tend to avoid it.
